# Titanic-Analysis-Project
The Project is a comprehensive analysis of the Titanic passenger data to derive insights into survival rates, passenger demographics, and other relevant factors. The analysis was conducted using Microsoft Excel, with a focus on accuracy, data visualization, and actionable insights.

## Objective
To analyze the Titanic dataset and extract insights regarding passenger survival rates, demographics, and other factors using Excel.

### Data Preparation: 
The dataset was cleaned to handle missing values and inconsistencies. Columns such as age and fare were formatted appropriately to ensure data integrity.

### Survival Analysis:
•	Overall Survival Rate: The analysis revealed an overall survival rate of 38%, with significant variations when segmented by gender and passenger class.

•	Gender-Based Survival: Female passengers had a higher survival rate of 68%, compared to male passengers at 32%.

•	Class-Based Survival: First-class passengers had the highest survival rate at 45%, followed by second-class at 7%, and third-class at 6%.
### Demographic Analysis:
•	Age Distribution: The age distribution showed that adult with the highest passengers followed by children and the elderly.

•	Gender Ratios: The gender ratio favoured male passengers, who constituted 65% of the total passengers.
### Family Size Analysis:
•	Impact on Survival: Passengers traveling with family members had a survival rate of 20%, while those traveling alone had a survival rate of 18%.

### Fare Analysis:
•	Class and Fare Relationship: Higher fares were associated with higher passenger classes, indicating a correlation between fare and socio-economic status.

### Embarked Port Analysis:
•	Survival Rates by Port: Passengers embarking from Southampton had the highest survival rate at 25%, followed by Cherbourg at 10%, and Queenstown at 3%.

## Recommendations: 
### Based on the insights derived from the analysis, the following recommendations are proposed:

•	Safety Measures: Implement safety measures that are equitable across all passenger classes.

•	Family Assistance: Provide additional support for passengers traveling with family members.

•	Fare Structure: Consider revising the fare structure to reflect modern socio-economic standards.

## Conclusion: 
The analysis of the Titanic dataset provides valuable insights into the factors that influenced survival rates. 

These findings can inform safety protocols and passenger services for modern maritime travel.
